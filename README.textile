h2. Quick start (Usage)

<pre>
  p1 = GeoPoint.new 51.5136, -0.0983
  p2 = GeoPoint.new(51.4778, -0.0015
  
  dist = p1.distance_to(p2) # in km                                             

  brng = p1.bearing_to(p2) # in degrees clockwise from north

  final_brng = p1.final_bearing_to(p2) # final bearing in degrees from north  

  mid = p1.midpoint_to point(p2) # midpoint between p1 and p2

  dest = p1.destination_point bearing, dist # Bearing in degrees, Distance in km
  
  GeoPoint.intersection p1, brng1, p2, brng2 # intersection between two paths
  
  p1.rhumb_distance_to(p2)
  
  p1.bearing_to(p2)  
  
  p1.rhumb_destination_point(brng, dist)
  
  p1.lat # latitude
  p2.lon # longitude
  p1.to_s # string rep
</pre>

The libary also comes wih a javascript file with the same functionality. See _js/geo_calc.js_ in the _/lib_ folder

h2. Contributing to geo_calc
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
